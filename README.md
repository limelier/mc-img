# Minecraft image creator

Simple image printing script that connects to a server via rcon and 
uses `/setblock` to print an image up to 256x256 in size.

Thanks to [RedHotRojo](https://github.com/RedHotRojo/Python-Draws-in-Minecraft)
for the inspiration, and for the list of blocks.

Possible improvements:
- a better list of blocks, with only solid blocks and taking into account 
blocks that have different textures on different sides
